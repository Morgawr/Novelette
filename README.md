# Novelette

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Morgawr/Novelette.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Morgawr/Novelette)

A ClojureScript engine used to develop Visual Novels and graphic storytelling on
the browser and node-webkit.

## Usage

The project is still heavily in development and is not yet ready for release.

There is a [planned roadmap/feature track list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNBiB1H9DMh2VBY9-hdHCaoOaOZXpdn_k2SEazDmqLY) on Google docs where I keep track
of what needs to be done and the development of new features.

Alternatively, a quick grep for "TODO" string on the source code will show what
minor or structural/refactoring issues need to be worked on.
